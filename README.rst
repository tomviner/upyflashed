upyflashed
==========

A command to watch for new hex files from https://github.com/ntoll/upyed

``upyflashed`` will poll your browser download directory for new hex
files. If one is found it will copy it to the micro:bit storage
location.

fixes gratefully accepted. Currently tested on Linux and Windows.
